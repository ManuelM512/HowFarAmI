# How Far Am I?
Have you ever played how long until you reach Y from X? This does exactly that.

Requirements:
- pip install lxml
- pip install fastapi

To run:
- fastapi run reacher_api.py
- Open the howFarAmI.html file and start playing

Disclaimer: This can take some time, it depends on how many pages there are between one link and the other.

Work to do:
- Give the user a way to know if it is searching or what is happening
- Search for the same link as the one that it started
- Change text in the inputs, to help the user with the format
- A Stop button maybe? 
- A better style wouldn't do it any bad...
- Improve Readme hehe
